        <P>Ingredients
            1 1/2 tablespoon of coriander
            1 tablespoon of cumin
            1 tablespoon of cloves
            1 teaspoon of cinnamon
            1 teaspoon of cardamom
            1 teaspoon of black pepper
            Depending on what spice you like more you can add or reduce some from the mix.
            Now that you have your masala lets get into the recipe.
            1/4 kg of boneless cubed lamb
            This can be replaced with goat or beef
            2 large onions finely chopped
            4 cloves of minced garlic
            1 teaspoon of Fresh ginger
            Pilau masala/mix
            2 large grated Carrots
            1 1/2 cups of clean rice
            1 tablespoon of salt
            3 cups of water
            2 tablespoons of vegetable oil.
            Instructions
            On medium high heat and in 2 tablespoons of oil, saut√© the chopped onions until they soften.
            Add in the cubed meat, stir the pieces into the onions and cover for about 5 minutes, until it starts to dry up and the meat starts browning.
            At this point the meat is not cooked through. Its cooking on high heat to get a nice brown that adds to the flavor. The meat will cook completely as the rice boils.
            Add in the ginger,garlic and 2 tablespoons of the pilau mix. Allow this to cook for about 2 minutes while stirring.
            Reduce the heat to low and Add in the grated carrots and the clean rice.
            Stir the rice and carrots until the rice is well coated in the spices.
            Add in the water and cover tightly with foil or a proper lid. Let this simmer on low heat for about 15 minutes until it starts crackling up to indicate that its dry.
            Take it off the heat and let it rest for about 5 minutes, fluff up the rice and serve.
